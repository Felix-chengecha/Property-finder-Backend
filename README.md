A property finder" app backend built using the Laravel framework to provide a server-side component for a property listing search application and booking.

The backend would handle all of the data management and API functionality for the app, such as storing, retrieving, and updating information about properties in a database.

It would handle the communication between the mobile application and the database by providing endpoints for the mobile app to access and perform CRUD operations on the data stored in the database.

It would also handle the user authentication and authorization, so that only authorized users can access certain parts of the data.

Please note that this is a brief description. For more details, such as how to test the backend, how to deploy,and   handle errors and troubleshoot,  view  the API documentation
